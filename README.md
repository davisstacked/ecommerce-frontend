This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
START JSON SERVER DATABASE
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

#PRODUCT CAROUSEL

An external library - react slick and slick-carousel was utilized for the carousel. The arrows from the figma design are hidden as industry-standard is for the right and left arrows to appear on top of the photo (Every library researched was implemented this way.)

#RESPONSIVE SIZING


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
